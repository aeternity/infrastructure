# Infrastructure management automation for Ã¦ternity nodes

Infrastructure is automatically created and managed by Ansible playbooks run by CircleCI.
Only changes to master branch are deployed.
Infrastructure is orchestrated with [OpenStack Heat](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/) and [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
Ansible playbooks are run against [dynamic host inventories](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html).

Below documentation is meant for manual testing and additional details. It's already integrated in CircleCI workflow.

## Requirements

- Python3
- [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

The commands below assume already installed dependancies and python3 virtual environment setup in `.venv/py3`.
To setup and activate the virtual environment run:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 .venv/py3 && source .venv/py3/bin/activate
```

To install pip dependancies and ansible roles run:
```bash
make
```

## Credentials setup

### OpenStack
You should make sure [OpenStack credentials are set](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/configuration/index.html#environment-variables)
either by environment variables or clouds.yml file.

```bash
source ~/my/secrets/openstack.rc
```

### Amazon Web Services

Yous should make sure [AWS CommandLine interface credentials are set](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#example-aws-ec2-external-inventory-script)
either by environment variables or `~/.aws/credentials` file.

If you have configured multiple AWS credentials you can pass AWS_PROFILE variable before the commands:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=aeternity ansible-inventory --list
```

### Ansible Secrets

Secrets are managed with [Ansible Vault](docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/vault.html).
There is a tiny bridge vault file `vault-env` that bridges the `INFRASTRUCTURE_ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable as Ansible vault password.

```
export INFRASTRUCTURE_ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD="top secret"
```

## Ansible playbooks

### Ansible dynamic inventory

Check that your OpenStack and AWS credentials are setup and dynamic inventory is working as excepted:
```bash
cd ansible && ansible-inventory --list
```

### Infrastructure setup

An environment infrastructure can be setup with `make setup`,
for example to setup `integration` environment infrastructure run:
```bash
make setup DEPLOY_ENV=integration
```

To create new environment edit the `ansible/environments.yml` playbook.

### Manage nodes

Start, stop, restart or ping nodes by running:
```bash
make manage-node DEPLOY_ENV=integration CMD=start
make manage-node DEPLOY_ENV=integration CMD=stop
make manage-node DEPLOY_ENV=integration CMD=restart
make manage-node DEPLOY_ENV=integration CMD=ping
```

### Reset network of nodes

To reset a network of nodes run:
```bash
make reset-net DEPLOY_ENV=integration
```

The playbook does:

- delete blockchain data
- delete logs
- delete chain keys
